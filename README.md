## Installation
You will need to have node.js installed using an IDE of your choice, MySQL downloaded on your local computer, as well as downloading the necessary node_modules using "npm install" prior to setting up the database. Additionally, you will need a way to perform CRUD operations on the database, such as using the application Insomnia.

## Usage
To use this application, please download the files and follow the installation instructions. From there, you can start the database (logging into MySQL and using command ("source db/schema.sql"). Then, seed the table with your categories/products/tags (using the phrase "npm run seed") and you can update your e-commerce database using Insomnia.
